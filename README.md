# Web Photo Frame

A modern web-based digital photo frame application featuring a React frontend and an Express/Node.js backend. It supports image sets, automatic thumbnail generation, and both slideshow and gallery views.

---

## Features

- **Frontend**: Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, serving images, thumbnails, and API endpoints.
- **Image Organization**: Organize images into sets (folders) under `public/pictures/`.
- **Automatic Thumbnails**: Thumbnails are generated by the backend and stored in `public/thumbnails/`.
- **Slideshow & Gallery**: Switch between slideshow and thumbnail grid views.
- **REST API**: Endpoints for image set metadata and image serving.
- **Proxy**: Vite dev server proxies API and image requests to the backend for seamless development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm

---

### 1. Install Dependencies

#### Frontend

```bash
npm install
```

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

---

### 2. Add Your Images

- Place your image sets in `public/pictures/`, each in its own subfolder (e.g., `nature`, `cities`, etc.).
- Thumbnails are generated automatically by the backend and stored in `public/thumbnails/` with the same folder and file names as the originals.

**Example:**
```
public/
  pictures/
    nature/
      simon-berger-twukN12EN7c-unsplash.jpg
  thumbnails/
    nature/
      simon-berger-twukN12EN7c-unsplash.jpg
```

---

### 3. Development

#### Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
- The backend runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

#### Start the Frontend

In a separate terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```
- The frontend runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.
- The Vite dev server proxies `/api`, `/pictures`, and `/thumbnails` requests to the backend.

---

### 4. Production Build

#### Build the Frontend

```bash
npm run build
```
- This outputs static files to the `dist/` directory.

#### Build and Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run build
npm start
```
- The backend will serve the frontend from the `dist/` directory and also serve images and API endpoints.

---

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/photo-sets`  
  Returns a list of all image set (folder) names.

- `GET /api/image-sets/:setName`  
  Returns metadata (including image and thumbnail URLs) for all images in the specified set.

- `GET /pictures/:set/:filename`  
  Serves original images.

- `GET /thumbnails/:set/:filename`  
  Serves thumbnail images.

---

## Customization

- **Add/Remove Image Sets**: Add or remove folders under `public/pictures/`.
- **Styling**: Modify `src/App.tsx`, `src/index.css`, or Tailwind config as needed.
- **API**: Extend backend routes in `backend/src/routes/`.

---

## Development Notes

- If you add new images, use the "Refresh" button in the UI to reload image sets.
- The backend automatically creates thumbnail folders and files as needed.
- The project uses modern React patterns and Radix UI components for accessibility and design.
